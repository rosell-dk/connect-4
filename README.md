# connect-4
Connect 4 game, implemented in Vue 3

I was challenged to implement a Connect-4 game in seven days, beginning from monday the 9th of May 2022.
The game should have state persistence and undo functionality


## Log:

### Day 1: Mission accomplished! :)
- A working game with state persistence and undo functionality
- Vue 3.2
- Vite
- npm
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for managing state
- Single file components, using Composition API and `<script setup>`


### Day 2 (the day ain't over yet)
- Switched to TypeScript
- Responsive design
- Fixed coding styles, applying to [the official Vue style guide](https://vuejs.org/style-guide/)
- Drop discs by pressing 1-9 on keyboard (makes it more comfortable to play on the same computer)

## Up next
- Publish build
- Upload demo
- Sass
- API version number (to prevent problems when loading old saved games)

## Other ideas
- Animation
- Redo
- Save game
- 3 player game (n player)
- Play against computer
- Replay
- Save the game as SVG animation
- Game settings: Board size
- Game settings: Number of players
- Game settings: Color, name and controller of players
- Rule variation: [PopOut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)
- Rule variation: Cylinder-Infinite Connect-Four
- Rule variation: [Power up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)
- Docker
