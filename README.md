# connect-4
Connect 4 game, implemented in Vue 3

I was challenged to implement a Connect-4 game in seven days, beginning from monday the 9th of May 2022.
The game should have state persistence and undo functionality


## Log:

### Day 1: Done ;)
- A working game with state persistence and undo functionality
- Vue 3.2
- Vite
- npm
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for managing state
- Single file components, using Composition API and `<script setup>`


### Day 2 (ongoing)
- Switched to TypeScript

## Up next
- Responsive
- Allow control with keyboard too
- Publish build
- Upload demo
- Sass

## Other ideas
- Animation
- Save game
- 3 player game (n player)
- Play against computer
- Replay
- Save the game as SVG animation
- Game settings: Board size
- Game settings: Number of players
- Game settings: Color, name and controller of players
